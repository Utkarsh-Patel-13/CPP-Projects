Stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form.
Stemming algorithms work by cutting off the end or the beginning of the word, taking into account a list of common prefixes and suffixes that can be found in an inflected word.
This indiscriminate cutting can be successful in some occasions, but not always, and that is why we affirm that this approach presents some limitations.


This project is a implementatin of one of the basic stemming algorithm, Porter's Stemmer.
